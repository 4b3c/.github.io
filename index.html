        <p>I created this project when I realized how useful chatgpt was. I wanted to get some practice using it so I created a project using it to create videos that were summaries of wikipedia articles in 5 facts.</p>
        <p>The project was a success in that I got over 70 subscribers and 19 thousand views, but it wasn't a success in how low quality the videos were. Many of them are confusing and some even have 10 facts instead of 5. It was all automated so I had no control over that.</p>
        <p>It worked by using the wikipedia python library to get the content of a wikipedia page, and using the chatgpt plugin to get 5 fun facts from that article.Then it googled each fact and downloaded the picture, and used amazon's text to speech library to generate audio. Finally it combined all the content using cv2 and then via webscraper, it uploaded the videos to youtube shorts.</p>

        <p>This project started as a school project but I had to finish it on my own when I ran out of time.</p>
        <p>I know it has been done before, but I wanted to experiment with neural networks, and especially learn how they worked, by making my own. Using the MNIST data set, I was able to program and train my own neural network to predict hand drawn digits.</p>

        <p>This project was designed to complement our FIRST robotics team's custom swerve drive and odometry programming.</p>
        <p>By plotting points, we could create smooth curves and generate waypoints for the robot to follow. The different paths can be added together and saved, or exported into the robot code to be used for an autonomous run.</p>
        <p>At the Arizona East 2023 Regional, we actaully won the autonomous award for demonstrating our unique way of programming our robot's autonomous period.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.9em; font-style: italic; margin: 10px; margin-left: 0;">Isometric Game</p>
        <p>This was a game that I've tried to create multiple times. It's been inspired by PolyTopia and the Earth 2 game on CoolMathGames.com.</p>
        <p>I tried many things, both creating it as an isometric game and as a 2D game but each time as the project grew, I got overwhelmed by how badly set up the code was at first. I do intend on restarting this project, probably when I decide to finally learn C++.</p>
        <p>For the isometric game I built a whole path finding algorithm so the little people could go back and forth and for the 2D version, I build a whole file/world saving system. I also experimented with perlin noise as I hope to add that in when I restart it.</p>
        <p>The main idea of the game is a combination of SimCity, Civilization VI, and polytopia, I love polytopia but I want much more emphasis on world building and resource management like sort of exists in the CIV games. I also hope to start a devlog when I learn C++ and revisit this project.</p>
